    logline: 'Becca cares for her elderly father, Tim, who suffers from dementia and spends his days transfixed by a TV that he keeps tuned to static. Becca\'s brother tries to convince her to place Tim in assisted living, which she resists, insisting that both her and Tim\'s life is better with him at home. After returning from a tour of the assisted living facility, Becca finds Tim seems to have taken a turn for the worse. He pushes her to join him in staring into the static, and she must decide whether to continue humoring him.'
